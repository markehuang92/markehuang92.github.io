    <h2>Centennial Plaza Groundbreaking Ceremony</h2>
    <p>Some of you may remember the Chungking Restaurant that was on this property.  My father, Voy Wong, was an immigrant from China who, along with some partners, bought the restaurant in 1942 from a Japanese American who was being relocated to an internment camp after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Voy and my mother, Fay Wong, ran the restaurant for 32 years.  They sold it in 1974 to another Chinese family, Harry and Lisa Chan, who operated Chungking for many more years before closing it permanently in the 1990s.
</p>
<p>When I heard that the Riverside Community College District was going to build a Culinary Arts Academy at this very location, I was pleased and marveled at the coincidence that the spirit of our restaurant would be continued through the RCC Culinary Arts Academy.  Also, how appropriate it was that the previous owner of our restaurant, the Japanese American, was part of the relocation story being told right next door at the Center for Social Justice and Civil Liberties.  I was also glad to hear that the Henry W. Coil, Sr. &amp; Alice Edna Coil School for the Arts was planned as my two sisters and I had majored in art.  There were so many connections that we wanted to share our story and to support this project.
</p>
<p>Returning to this location brought back memories of my life in Riverside.  As we were growing up, Chungking became our second home.  The five of us children, Ellen, Don, Janlee, Julie and I helped our parents by working at the restaurant after school and on weekends.  My first job was filling the egg basket for the cooks, advancing up to my last job as a waitress while I was in high school.
</p>
<p>It wasn’t all work and no play though.  The stacked boxes of food stuffs became our fort.  After hours, we straddled the backs of the tall red booths riding them like horses, or we played “Red Light, Green Light” in the darkened dining room.  In the back office room, we had our own little record player to play the 78’s and 45’s that we got to keep from the juke box.  We put on plays like Rapunzel and the Three Little Bears.  The neighboring White Park became our backyard.  We had a favorite “airplane” tree that we climbed and jumped from.  We named the succulent and cactus garden “Little Texas” and the palm grove, “Africa”.  We launched our homemade sailboats in the fountain.
</p>
<p>Growing up in the 50’s and 60’s was not easy for a Chinese immigrant family.  Back then, there was not much diversity in Riverside.  We were actually the only “Wongs” in the phone book for several years.  When my parents had saved enough money to buy a house, the realtor polled the neighborhood.  Since there was only one objection, they were able to purchase the home which 50 years later, Fay gifted to UC Riverside.
</p>
<p>Through all our hard work, we persevered and my parents were able to achieve their American dream of finding a better life in America and ensuring an education for us.  They valued education so much that they rewarded each one of us with a car as a high school graduation present.  They were able to support all five of us through college.  Ellen and Don attended Riverside City College and transferred to UC’s.  Janlee, Julie and I began our studies at UC Riverside, but we also took summer classes at Riverside City College.
</p>
<p>So as this property on the corner of Market Street and University Avenue evolves again, we realize the underlying threads of history that connect all of us.   We would like to thank Chancellor Dr. Cynthia Azari, the Board of Trustees, the Riverside Community College District Foundation, The Coil Family and the City of Riverside for their vision in creating the Centennial Plaza bringing culinary and cultural arts, and social justice and civil liberties dialogue to downtown Riverside.  The Wong Family would also like to thank them for giving us the opportunity to support this project as well as honoring our parents, Voy and Fay, and the spirit of one of the first Chinese restaurants in Riverside.
