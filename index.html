  <section>
    <p><strong></strong>Welcome to the Voy and Fay Wong webpage!* The Wong Family was a well known Chinese immigrant family in Riverside during the second half of the 20th Century. Starting with the Chinese immigration to California during the 19th Century, Chinese came to Riverside during the 1870's to work on ranches and farms as Riverside became established as a city and community. 20 Chinese (all male) were recorded on the first federal census in Riverside in 1880.  The Chinese made significant contributions to the Riverside and Inland Empire citrus industry introducing several varieties of oranges and developing an orange packing  method called the Chinese pack which allowed oranges of different sizes to be packed in layers ending with an even layer on top.
</p>
<p>Chinese were arriving to Riverside and San Bernardino during this period with many Chinese settling in San Bernardino after working on a number of southern California railroads. Chinese also migrated from Mexico to the area.
</p>
<p>Sam Wong (Wong Chun Yee) was one of these Chinese who established a dry goods business, Gee Chung Co., in San Bernardino and eventually, his two sons, Poy and Voy, immigrated from the old country.
</p>
<p>Voy Wong (Wong Gan Voy, aka Wong Gow Doy) came to Riverside in 1937.  At the outbreak of World War II, he purchased a restaurant business with two partners, Edward Wong (Wong Bing Tew) and Harold Wong (Yik Sik) from a Japanese American forced to relocate to an internment camp.  They renamed the restaurant Chungking after the war time capital of China.
</p>
<p>Thus began the story of the Wongs of Riverside. After the war, Voy brought his wife, Fay Hing Lee, to America.  They started a family and eventually bought out the other partners.  With hard work and their five children, Ellen, Don, Janlee, Linda and Julie, helping out, Chungking Restaurant became a successful business for 32 years.
</p>
<p>*About how this webpage came about:  The original Riverside Wongs website was created by Janlee and was on <em>home.pacbell.net</em> for 10 years.  When the site was discontinued, Janlee was able to quickly create www.<strong><a href="http://riversidewongs.net">riversidewongs.net</a></strong> powered by Google forms.  In the meanwhile, Ellen and Linda wanted to create a website with an original design.  They worked with Ellen's son, Zachary, for a bold clean look. The next step was to build the website which Ellen's other son, Michael, took on through his start up, Webhook.  The creation of www.<a href="http://voyfay.com"><strong>voyfay.com</strong></a> was truly a collaborative effort utilizing the talents and skills of family members. Tragically, Ellen developed ALS and the project was put on hold for a few years.  After her untimely death in 2011, Linda was determined to finish the project in her honor.
</p>
<p>Linda didn't want to duplicate the content of www.<em>riversidewongs.net</em>.  Since www.<em>voyfay.com</em> was a website born of the creative spirit, Linda decided it would be a website for the descendants of Voy and Fay to express their childhood memories, feelings and visual talents.  The www.<em>voyfay.com</em> website would compliment the www.<em>riversidewongs.net</em> website.  The www.<em>riversidewongs.net</em> gives an overarching historical perspective of Voy and Fay's life.  You will find a family tree, old photographs and documents, immigration papers from the National Archives, current material, and links to other related sites.
</p>
<p>UC Riverside has two related links: <strong>www.vrc.ucr.edu/wongsite/family </strong>and<strong> </strong><strong>www.asianamericanriverside.ucr.edu</strong>
</p>
<p>This website, www.<em>voyfay.com,</em> is dedicated to Ellen, our "second mother and trail blazer," who inspired and introduced us to the world of art, without, life would be lacking.
